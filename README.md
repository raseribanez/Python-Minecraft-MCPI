# Python-Minecraft-MCPI
Python + Minecraft = In Progress!!!!

All this time Ive had the Raspberry Pi sitting there, Ive even had a mess about with the default version of Minecraft
that comes with Raspbian....but I never made the connection between Python...and Minecraft

So you can start a game of Minecraft, and connect to it using Python

Why?

Hacking minecraft opens up a whole world of possibility. You can use Python scripts to build huge structures
and thats just the start - you can make interactive games as-well - mini games within minecraft!

So as I get familiar with the coding and find out some cool techniques...I will be uploading the codes

So far I can do simple stuff like  create the connection, and print messages to the Minecraft screen, plus
using Python I can for example - select a specific block, and create a grid say 10 x 10 x 10 and it will build a 
structure 10 x 10 blocks square...and 10 blocks high. I can also run a few lines of code to make a real flowing volcanoe

Another little cool thing I have figured out - now I aint a minecraft addict - I never played it before I had the 
Raspberry Pi, but I found it was very basic....based on a pocket version I believe - for phones and tablets.
So theres blocks like Lava and Dynamite, and Water that just dont do anything....I read that in full on versions of
minecraft, you can activate dynamite and other blocks etc etc In the RPi version you cant

Using Python you can set the blocks to do things, and set a timer for the dynamite - so it is really cool

As I mess around with it, I will keep a folder of scripts, and upload them when they are worth uploading!

I also have some code from mcpipy's repo and a few others that do some awesome stuff so I might put a few of them up here but obviously I want the permission first!
